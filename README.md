# Business-Insights-sales_data

## Overview

This project involves analyzing anonymized sales data using Python, Power BI, and Excel to extract actionable insights and recommendations. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, advanced analytics, and dashboard reporting.

Tools Used

Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

Power BI (interactive dashboard creation)

Excel (data cleaning and pivot analysis)

### Objectives

The main objectives of this analysis include:

Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales performance.

Conducting advanced analysis such as customer segmentation, forecasting, and anomaly detection.

Providing strategic insights and recommendations based on data trends.

Creating an interactive dashboard for business intelligence.

Sections

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation 

Inspected data for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types.

Did feature engineering such as created a "Month-Year" column from the "DATE" column for time-based analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Sales Overview: Calculated total Quantity and Value grouped by:

Anonymized Category

Anonymized Business

Trends Over Time: Analyzed sales trends using a time series plot to detect seasonal patterns.

Performance Analysis:

Identified the top 5 most frequently purchased products.

Identified the top 5 most valuable products.

### 3. Advanced Analysis 

Customer Segmentation: Categorized businesses into High, Medium, and Low-Value groups based on:

Total Quantity purchased

Total Value contributed

Frequency of transactions

Provided recommendations for engagement with each group.

Forecasting: Predicted total sales (Value) for the next 3 months using ARIMA/moving average/exponential smoothing.

Anomaly Detection: Identified unusual spikes or drops in sales performance and explored potential causes.

Correlation Analysis: Examined relationships between Quantity and Value to determine sales drivers.

### 4. Strategic Insights and Recommendations 

Product Strategy: Recommended a product category to prioritize for marketing campaigns.

Customer Retention: Identified businesses with declining purchase frequency and suggested re-engagement strategies.

Operational Efficiency: Proposed improvements for inventory management and supply chain processes.

### 5. Dashboard and Reporting 

Created an interactive dashboard on Power BI summarizing key insights:

Total Quantity and Value by Anonymized Category.

Top-performing products and businesses.

Time-series chart of sales trends.

Customer segmentation summary.

Provided screenshots and links to the Power BI dashboard.

Proposed a methodology for incorporating external factors (e.g., economic conditions, competitor actions) into future predictive analyses.

Suggested optimizations for handling a dataset 10 times larger, focusing on data storage and processing efficiency.
